# Financial 

Leaving school in debt was a bit of a struggle. 4 years of OSAP really adds up and is difficult to pay off. Not only OSAP, but buying a house, groceries, rent, etc, all add up. This economy is rough but I am making it work. I have my partner beside me to help if anything goes wrong and always have someone to rely on. I feel comfortable now, leaving Ontario was a good move for me because I was able to control my financial problems and live in another province where it's a lot more affordable.

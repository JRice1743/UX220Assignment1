# Profession

After graduating with a degree in Digital Media and Journalism, I decided that this career was not for me. I attended Fire Academy after getting my degree and now I work for a fire station helping save lives. I wanted to go into sports analysts but it was too much of a competitive field for me. It was hard finding jobs like that around me and I always felt firefighting was my true calling. I wanted to follow in my grandfather footsteps.

# Portfolio Goals

In this article I found, It speaks about how important it is for students creating portfolios for their future goals. The article talks about how students will learn to be more prepared when entering employment or life after university/college. The creation of these portfolios helps them attain skills that will not only benefit them but prepare them for different settings they will encounter. The process of this creation was sort of built like a journal. Students would create an "About Me" page, "Reflection" page and a "Program Artifact" page. Throughout the students year, they would add to their portfolio, eventually leaving them with skills on how to achieve their goals. This can be compared to my goals because in order to achieve my goals in the next 5 years, I have to be organized and committed. Something like this would help me do that. Creating a little portfolio with similar sections as they had in the article, will help me stay on-top of things. In order for me to be financially stable, become a firefighter, qualifying for marathons and having a family, I have to be organized and prepared. So that is why this article is relatable to my goals because it is an efficient way to slowly prepare myself to attain those goals in my future. Citation: Cleveland, R.E.

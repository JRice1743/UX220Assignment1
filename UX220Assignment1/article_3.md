# Sports

After graduating Laurier, I continued being active. I still love to run, it's a passion that I will always have. I don't run competitive anymore like I did for Laurier during my undergrad studies but I have completed some marathons and qualified for the Boston Marathon. Sports have always played a key role in my life, either by watching them or participating, and they will always be a part of my life and my personality.

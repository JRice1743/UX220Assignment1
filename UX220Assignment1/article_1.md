# Family

After leaving school, my two sisters got married and started to have their own family. It's cool being an uncle at this age. For me, I am still taking my time with marriage and kids, seeing where life takes me. My parents are both happy and still together after all these years. Meanwhile, they got a new dog and I still have my cat with me.
